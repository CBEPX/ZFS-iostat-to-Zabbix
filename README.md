# ZFS-iostat-to-Zabbix
Shell script that sends ZFS (zpool) iostat output to a Zabbix server

Written by Søren Sørensen and Kenneth Lutzke.

This script will send zpool iostat output to your Zabbix server at a given interval.

This script has been tested on ZFS-on-Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) and FreeBSD (10.0 and 10.1).

We post this, as we could not find any solution to this problem, and others seem to be in the same boat.

Documentation on how to use this, is in the script itself.

We hope this will bring joy to your Zabbix graphs :)
